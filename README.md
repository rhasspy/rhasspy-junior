Simplified voice control for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

    "Hey Mycroft, turn on kitchen lights"

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of a Supervisor add-on.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=47701997_rhasspy_junior&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frhasspy%2Fhassio-addons)

## Training and Running

Before trainig, create a local TOML configuration file with the following content:

``` toml
[train.home_assistant]
api_url = '<home assistant url>'
api_token = '<home assistant token>'

[handle.home_assistant]
api_url = '<home assistant url>'
api_token = '<home assistant token>'
```

Replace `<home assistant url>` with something like `http://localhost:8123/api` and `<home assistant token>` with a long-lived access token.

Run `scripts/train.sh --config your-local-config.toml` to train. This will load entities from your home assistant server and train a custom speech to text and intent recognizer model.

Run `scripts/run.sh --config your-local-config.toml` to start Rhasspy Junior. You should now be able to say "Hey Mycroft, turn on the kitchen lights" (depending on what devices you have configured).
